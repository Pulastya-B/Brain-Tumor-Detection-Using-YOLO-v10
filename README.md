# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-YOLO-v10

This project implements a deep learning-based approach to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using the latest YOLO v10 object detection architecture. The model is trained to accurately localize and classify brain tumors, providing a fast and efficient tool for assisting in medical diagnosis.

🚀 **Highlights**
1.Utilizes YOLO v10, the newest version of the state-of-the-art object detection model.

2.Trained on a labeled dataset of brain MRI images.

3.Capable of detecting and localizing tumors in real-time with high accuracy.

4.Lightweight and optimized for performance.

📂 **Features**
1.Data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline.

2.YOLO v10 training and validation scripts.

3.Inference and visualization of results.

4.Model evaluation using precision, recall, and mAP.

📌** Usage**
1.Clone the repository

2.Prepare the dataset

3.Train or use pretrained weights for inference

4.Visualize the detection results
